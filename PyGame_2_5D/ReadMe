This is a 2.5D Render with some features.
I was really interest in 3D graphics.
The documentation is in German, sorry.
I was to lazy to translate it.
You need PyGame for Python3.
If you use Ubuntu, you can execute pygame_install.sh script.
How to test the demo:
	Open in Terminal and type in: python3 demo.py

For Windows:
	Install Python 3 and pygame for Python 3
	Then doppleclick on the file demo.py

P.S. Sorry if my English is bad...
